## Other notes

User
- user must have at least an email in order to purchase in order to receive the invoice
- Account does not need to be created - the purchase can be separated from user account

user {
	id (PK) = 1
	name = john
	password = xxx
	email = john.doe@mail.com
	phone = 0123456789
}

Movie
- how to ensure movies are unique?
- ops can add new movies
movie {
	id (PK) = 1
	name = Titanic
	description = Ship sank because it hits an iceberg
	release_date = 2019-01-01
	language = Singapore
}

Cinema
- the cinema can be in different location

cinema {
	id (PK) = 1â€¨	name = ABC Plaza
}


CinemaHall
- one cinema can have many halls
- each halls can have a limited number of seats
- the cinema hall can hold the number of seats if it is fixed
- query: getHallsByCinema
- query: getHallsCountByCinema

cinema_hall {
	id (PK) = 1
	cinema_id (FK) = 1
	name = Hall A
	seats_count = 20
}

SeatType 
- each seats can be of different category (bronze, silver, gold)
- the pricing could be different for different seat type
- each seats will have a location (for the Frontend to display the seat selection)

seat_type {
	id (PK) = 1
	name = bronze
}
seat_type {
	id (PK) = 2
	name = silver
}
seat_type {
	id (PK) = 2
	name = gold
}

CinemaHallSeat
- each hall have a limited number of seats
- the rows are usually numbered as A-Z
- the columns are usually numbered 1-n, where n is the maximum number of seats per row
- each seats may have a category (premium, back, couple)
- the seats category may be charged separately
- query: getSeatsByCinemaHall
- query: getSeatsCountByCinemaHall

cinema_hall_seat {
	seat_id (PK)(UID) = a1
	cinema_hall_id (FK)(UID) = 1
	seat_type_id = 1 (bronze)
}

Showtime
- each cinema can screen a movie on specific date and time
- the screening time cannot collide between movies
- the same movie can be screen at different times on the same day
- the same movie can be screening at the same time in different halls
- query: getMoviesScreeningByCinema
- screening date may have different pricing on different days
- pricing might be different for different seats

showtime {
	id (PK) = 1
	cinema_id (FK)(UID) = 1
	cinema_hall_id (FK) (UID) = 1
	movie_id (FK)(UID) = 1
	start_at (UID)
	end_at
	// Virtual
	// duration_in_hours: is computed from the difference between end and start 
}

Booking
- the booking must be unique (cannot be double booked), and hence the criteria for booking should be (movieID, cinemaID, screenTime, seatID)
- the booking can have a status (pending) and will locked the seats for 5 minutes, unless the user cancels it

booking {
	id (PK) = 1
	showtime_id (FK) = 1
	user_id (FK) (UID) = 1
	type = phone/online/person
	paid = true
	reserved = true
}

booking_seat {
	booking_id (PK)(UID)
	seat_id (FK)(UID) = A1
}

concurrency
- user can select a seat 
- the seat can be chosen by another user at the same time
- the user should be informed that the seat is already locked
- the user should be able to retry it after the locked period
- what if there are multiple users aiming for the same seat 
- they should be placed in the queue so that it follows the first come first serve principle
